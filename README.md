This course aims to take you through a series of 5 lessons so that you can integrate Generative AI in your JavaScript apps. 

To make it a fun learning experience, we've added a narrative to each lesson. It's a *time travelling adventure* where you will encounter famous characters throughout history! ‚ú®

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the content in this repository is open-source, so feel free to **reuse it, adapt it to make it your own, and share it with others!**

## An immersive learning experience, step into history!

Want to live history through the power of Generative AI? Of course you do, here's how:

This is an immersive learning experience. Here's what you're getting:

- **Fun time travelling narrative**. Each lesson comes with a time travelling narrative where you get to meet and converse with a historical figure.
- **Companion app**, the curriculum comes with a companion app that lets you talk to all its historical figures, Ada Lovelace, Montezuma and many more, through the power of Generative AI, did I say it has sound?
- **Accessible**, accessibility is top of mind of course, you can not only read this content but there's audio tags you can try out, even the characters speaks to you.

> This is learning reimagined with Generative AI

## üå± Getting Started

Along this course you'll find many code examples and exercises, so we encourage you to run and experiment with the code in your own copy of this repository:

1. Select the **Fork** button in the upper right-hand corner of the repository or select this button:
   [![Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fork-Repository-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-with-javascript/fork)

2. On your forked repository, select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, then **Create codespace**. This will create a preconfigured online environment for you. You'll then be able to use [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) to run the code examples and interact with LLMs for free, without any additional setup. 

<details>
<summary><h3>Using your local environment</h3></summary>

If you prefer working in your local environment, first you need to install the following tools:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

 Then after forking the repository, you can clone it to your local machine:

1. On your forked repository, select the **Code** button, then the **Local** tab, and copy the URL of your forked repository. 
2. Open a terminal and run this command to clone the repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
3. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.

### üì¶ Each Lesson Includes

- A **written lesson** with an assignment and quiz.
- A short **video**, to help further your learning.
- **Solution** for assignment and quiz.
- **Character app**: running this app demonstrates Generative AI and gives you a chance to have conversation with a historical figure.
